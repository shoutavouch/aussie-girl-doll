            <p>
              We believe every child deserves stories that reflect their world and inspire
              new adventures. Each doll arrives with a personality story card to spark
              imagination.

            <p>
              Soft-touch materials, detailed outfits, and thoughtful accessories make every
              doll a keepsake. We focus on quality, durability, and comfort.
